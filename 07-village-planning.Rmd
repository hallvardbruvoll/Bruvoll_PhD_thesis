## Settlement layout and social structure

Or the social organisation of village layout. Research background:

Lit. use @furholt2016, @fraser1968, @ensor2017a, @ensor2013, also check @souvatzi2017.

For cities, see @kostof1991

@artursson2010 (Bronze Age, descriptive/interpretive approach). @cleuziou1999 (book in MAE)

Use the Trypillia volumes. Also @müller-scheeßel2019, @trebsche2010

Transition from village to urban (again): @birch2014.

Factors affecting village layout:

-   Political structure (but, as with hierarchy, an organised layout does not necessarily equate top-down despotic decision making).

-   Kinship, matrimonial and locality structures

-   Cosmology (e.g. Linear Pottery house orientations)

-   Economic and ritual functions of village elements (constructed and non-constructed)

-   Local landscape setting (to be factored out)

## The geometries of conscious planning vs. emergent behaviour

-   I need to find some references here! @eglash1999

-   Euclid: grids, lines, circles -- how humans think in shapes. Social settings: architect/planner, strong common institutions/ideals (examples?)

-   Mandelbrot: irregular, self-similar, scale independent (i.e. fractal) shapes -- emergent, not consciously preconceived. Self-organisation. Does the "no pattern" case exist? Emergence from repetitive sequences of simple choices/mechanisms. Examples.

-   Binary or continuum? Needs to be studied empirically.
