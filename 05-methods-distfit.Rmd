# Methods: Distribution fitting

## Heavy-tailed distributions, testing for power laws

-   Technical characteristics of power laws, @newman2005, do I need more?

-   Old style distribution fitting (which is used in @brown2010 and @brown2005 and check.

-   New style presented in @clauset2009, implemented in R with the poweRlaw package @gillespie2015, and used in @strawinska-zanko2018 and @crabtree2017. More recent?

## Methodological procedure

-   Synthetic data genaration

-   Parameter settings: dist. types, xmin, testing the pl hypothesis etc. Minimal house-count cutoff (min. sample size). Isolating top house.

-   Phasing of Vr√°ble

-   

## Notes on terminology: Power law, Pareto and Zipf

-   A law (distribution) is not a law (of nature), see @grove2011 for review of the long-lasting confusion in Archaeology (e.g. @hodder1979), also rank-size " rule"
-   Zipf law and Settlement Scaling theory, @bettencourt2021, @gomez-lievano2012, @lobo2020 (possibly move this to preceding chapter). Why I'm not doing settlement scaling in this study.
