## Calculating fractal dimension and lacunarity

-   Box-counting, lit. @mancuso2021, @li2009, @klinkenberg1994

-   Gliding-box algorithms, @allain1991, @hingee2019, @cheng1997, @plotnick1996

-   Caveats:

    -   Fractional box-counting dimension does not equal self-similarity in a simple way

    -   My summary *L* is not equal to the one used in *FracLac* and thus by @far√≠as-pelayo2017

-   Image preparation procedure

## Testing on Euclidean and self-similar layouts

fds

## Testing on density, element count and size distribution

## Summary of procedure and tests

-   Procedure for archaeological samples, same as in article

-   Procedure for synthetic sample
