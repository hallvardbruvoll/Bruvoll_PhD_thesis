# 1 Synthetic distributions -----------------------------------------------

# 1.1 Multiplicative process: from normal to power-law and back again -----

# OBS, the poweRlaw package doesn't include normal distributions. To start with
# that is not a problem, since the distribution is constructed as normal.
# When going back, use shapiro.test() to test for normality.

# Reproducible random number sequence
set.seed(100)

# Make a random variable for rates of change.
# A rate of 1 generates no change. Below 1 is decrease, above is increase
# Mean and standard deviation can be played around with
change <- rnorm(1000, mean = 1, sd = 0.4)

# if min(change) < 0
change <- change-min(change)
