## Possible reasons for house-size difference

In archaeology there are two recurrent and seemingly contradicting assumptions underlying interpretations of house-size differences within a society. In studies where the goal is to provide population size estimates, this is often calculated from total living area, adding together the areas of the houses in question, and multiplying by a mean value of surface per inhabitant (**give examples**). This mean value is generally obtained from multiple ethnographic parallels. With this assumption -- that every inhabitant requires a similar amount of living space (**mention actual values from literature**) -- the size of a house effectively reflects its number of inhabitants. The second assumption, which is more frequently seen in studies focussing on wealth inequality and social stratification, is that house-size differences are expressions of differences in some sort of wealth or power (**give examples**). In this view, a larger house would have belonged to a wealthier household, capable of procuring more raw materials and activating a larger labour force for its construction and maintenance, in which case there would be significant disparities in living space per individual. Even though there is not necessarily any contradiction between these two interpretations from an anthropological point of view, most archaeologists seem to be unable to consider both possibilities simultaneously. From a methodological point of view, each of these assumptions will tend to mask our ability to see traces in the archaeological data relating to the other assumption -- that is, with existing methods we cannot convincingly provide estimations of both population size and level of social inequality from the same data, even though house sizes frequently form the basis of both argumentations. Far from proposing a solution to this issue, my argument here is that a variety of social institutions known from ethnography and historical sources can explain some level of correlation between the two variables. Dowry and bride price are geographically and temporally widespread practices that link number of offspring (daughters, sons or both, depending on cultural context) with wealth. Clan leaders may draw upon kinship ties and dependencies in order to obtain the workforce needed to construct a larger house (**citation needed**). Nevertheless, if the notion of wealth is at all to be applied meaningfully to non-capitalistic societies, it should designate cases where there is significant and persistent material disparities between members of a population, and not simply point to different household sizes. House sizes could thus potentially reflect a somewhat more complex culture-specific interplay between household size and wealth, meaning that for a given house size, one could assume a range of possible values of the two parameters (**insert fig/illustration**). This relationship between household size, wealth and house size should be studied more in detail empirically through the available ethnographic data, rather than reducing its complexity to a mean surface area per inhabitant for the entire population. Such a study, however, lies beyond the scope of the present thesis. Here I will largely leave aside the question of population and household size, focussing on distribution types of house size data, arguing that the most unequal distribution type considered here -- the power-law distribution -- is unlikely to emerge only from random differences in household size and standard marital patterns, favouring thus interpretations relating to wealth and/or power differences.

Even though the goal here is not to investigate household sizes but to focus on the material aspect of house-size distributions, some fundamental issues of terminology should be addressed. The use of the word *house* (in the wider material sense rather than the Lévi-Straussian sense, see Section \@ref(social-hierarchy)) is indicative of an underlying assumption that the building in question was in use primarily for domestic purposes -- essentially, a fixed architectural unit where someone would spend their nights at least most of their time, and in many cases also cook and eat their main meal during the day -- though proving this directly is not always straightforward in archaeology. For the cultural contexts discussed here -- the Linear Pottery and Trypillia groups in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic -- there is however little evidence for buildings with specific non-domestic (e.g. economic, religious or administrative) purposes, with the probable exception of the so-called mega-structures or assembly houses in the Trypillia mega-sites, which are discussed more in detail below. This lack of evidence does not imply that there was no specialised economic, religious or administrative activity in these societies, as ethnography and history clearly shows that such activity must reach a certain degree of specialisation before it materialises in distinct buildings devoted exclusively for these functions. Artisans, shamans and chiefs could be specialised to some extent but still perform their activity at their domestic home or more diffusely outdoors or without any fixed location [e.g. @costin1991, p. 25]. It is in any case of common usage to speak of houses when discussing architectural units in Neolithic Europe and other prehistoric contexts, maybe because of a lack of a better generic word, but this usage should not prevent archaeologists from recognising other non-domestic functions of buildings whenever there is evidence for it. The *household* is furthermore the designation of all the people, genealogically related or not, usually living under the same roof or within the same architectural unit, constituting a functional whole economically and socially, and potentially including more than a single family unit, as well as servants or slaves, depending on the context.

Kinship studies within anthropology have shown over the last decades that in most societies, contrarily to common misconception, kin affiliation is *not* simply a matter of biological relatedness. In an attempt of grouping together all possible justifications for kinship ties, Marshall Sahlins [@sahlins2013] defined kinship as "mutuality of being" -- that some real or imagined substance is shared, and that this substance is not necessarily genes, as is mostly the case in modern Western societies (with adoption as the main exception). A variety of non-genetic foundations of kinship are widely accepted in different cultures, like sharing of name, time or place of birth or childhood, food source, shared experiences, blood ties, and so on. At the same time, archaeology as a whole has arguably been very slow in taking this diversity of kinship configurations into account, far too often taking for granted the modern Western (especially post-war 20th century) ideal of patrilineal nuclear families as the default configuration for all of human history [e.g. @ensor2021]. That being said, anthropological kinship studies such as that represented by Sahlins typically shows little concern with material culture, and is mostly silent on the question of who -- at the end of the day, quite literally -- sleeps under the same roof, making it hard to interpret domestic architecture in terms of kinship structure and social organisation. The recent comeback of kinship studies in archaeology has been far more focussed on linking isotope and aDNA data with social structures, largely fuelled by the rapid developments of the related methodologies [e.g. @carpenter2022 ; ]

P. Květina and J. Řídký point out both architecture (construction, size, orientation) and settlement layout as possible distinctive features between Big Men (achievement-based) and Chief societies, arguing that the former type may be recognised by a dispersed intra-settlement layout combined with uniform architecture, while the latter type would tend towards more regular settlement layout and more marked differences in architecture [! @kvetina2019, p. 13].

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms {#distributions}

The main question in this part of the thesis is on the nature of house-size differences in the studied contexts, and to explain them either as being due to random fluctuations or as a material expression of a more structural inequality, or something in-between. In statistical terms, this is a question of distributions. A distribution is a mathematical model of the spread of data along a variable or axis, and it can be modelled on empirical data as a succinct description, or used to predict unobserved data (e.g. future developments, or, in the case of archaeology, data that is lost to taphonomy). In theory, there is an infinite number of possible distributions, as there is no limit to how many parameters one can include to fit the data [@johnson1994, Check p. numbers]. It is however generally considered good practice in statistics to limit the number of parameters and identify the simplest possible model that gives a good fit, since a larger number of parameters can often lead to a better fit, but at the same time be harder to explain in terms of underlying mechanisms. Adding many parameters only to achieve a marginally better fit is referred to as *overfitting* (#ref?), and for most real-world contexts there is a limited number of model types that can be considered reasonable candidates. In cases where we are interested in inequality or uneven distributions of data (so-called *skewed* distributions), the most likely distribution models are those that can be described as *heavy-tailed*, meaning that on typical graphical representations (like density/PDF plots or histograms) they will show a characteristic stretch of some of the data towards the right end of the x-axis, while most of the data remains on the left side (Figure #ADD illustration). The opposite orientation is also possible in theory, in which case the distribution can be referred to as left-tailed. It is important to keep in mind however, that not all distributions are heavy-tailed, and that other distributions also model the spread of data across a variable, but result from very different underlying mechanisms. Identifying the most likely distribution model for a data series is therefore crucial for understanding how the data could have been generated. And though it is true that one model type can have multiple different explanations -- in an archaeological setting for example, many different social behaviours can lead to the same material outcome, an issue known as *equifinality* -- excluding one or more model types for the observed data can help limiting the number of plausible interpretations considerably.

Distributions can be represented graphically in a number of ways, most commonly in a coordinate system with the variable on the x-axis and its density, or *probability density function* (PDF), on the y-axis (#Fig again). Often, and in many of the sources cited in this part of the thesis [e.g. @clauset2009], the PDF is denoted by $p(x)$, reading as *the probability of x*, or simply $f(x)$ (*the function of x*). It gives the probability for a drawn sample ($X$) of falling within a given arbitrary range of the distribution, written $Pr(x \le X \lt x+dx)$. By definition, the area between the PDF curve and the x-axis sums to 1. For reasons that are further discussed in Chapter \@ref(methods-distfit), heavy-tailed distributions, and power laws in particular, are instead often represented with their *cumulative distribution function* (CDF), which is the integral of the PDF (inversely the PDF is the derivative of the CDF). Similarly to the PDF, the CDF is often denoted as $P(x)$, depending on disciplinary tradition. It indicates the probability of a sample value being equal to or lower than the function value, or $Pr(X \le x)$. Furthermore, the specific version of the CDF used for plotting heavy-tailed distributions, is the *complementary* or upper tail CDF (sometimes referred to as the *survival function*, or denoted cCDF), which is $1-CDF$ or $P(X \ge x)$, indicating the probability that a sample is higher than the function value. Both axes on such cCDF plots are traditionally set on logarithmic scales, usually $\log_{10}$ for readability. To avoid confusion, in this thesis I refer to PDF and cCDF for density and distribution functions respectively (except in equations, where I use $p(x)$ and $P(x)$ respectively), and all PDFs are plotted on linear scales and cCDFs on $\log_{10}$ scales, unless otherwise stated.

In the following, I present briefly the main distribution types that will be discussed further in the following chapters, with special focus on the *power-law distribution*, which is the model type associated with fractals and structural hierarchy. All of these distributions are modelled on continuous univariate data series [see @johnson1994 for more detailed presentations]. Even though their mathematical definitions may seem complicated to non-initiated readers, most of the distribution types discussed in this thesis are readily implemented in standard statistical software, including Microsoft Excel, allowing for a more straight-forward use of them. For this thesis, I used base *R* functions for calculating PDFs and cCDFs, and for random number generation for normal, log-normal and exponential distributions [@R2023], and equivalent functions from the *poweRlaw* package for power-law and Weibull/stretched exponential distributions [@gillespie2015].

### Normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

One of the distribution models that are the most commonly referred to and well-known, is the *normal distribution*, also known as the "Bell Curve" due to the characteristic bell shape of its PDF (#Fig.), or Gaussian after mathematician C.F. Gauss who contributed to its exploration in the early 19^th^ century. Its characterising parameters are the *mean* (denoted $\mu$, *mu*) and standard deviation ($\sigma$, *sigma*), and the PDF is defined mathematically as $$p(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2} $$ where $e$ (*Euler's number*) and $\pi$ (*pi*) are mathematical constants [@johnson1994, pp. 80-8]. This distribution is centred around its mean, with dwindling amounts of data spread outwards to either side. The mean -- commonly known and widely used in daily speech -- is the sum of all observations divided by number of observations, or $\mu = (\sum_{i=1}^nx_i)\,\frac{1}{n}$. The spread of the data from the mean is defined by the standard deviation, which is the square root of the mean of all squared deviations from the overall mean, or $\sigma = \sqrt{(\sum_{i=1}^n(x-\mu)^2)\,\frac{1}{n}}$ . Mathematically, the square of the standard deviation, $\sigma^2$, or *variance*, is simpler, but since it is also less intuitive, I refer here to the former whenever possible. The standard deviation can be thought of as the mean of all deviations, positive or negative, from the overall mean. The great importance the normal distribution has to a wide range of phenomena is explained through the Central Limit Theorem, according to which
