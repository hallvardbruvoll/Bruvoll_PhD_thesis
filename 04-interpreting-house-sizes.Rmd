# House sizes and social meaning

## What is social hierarchy?

-   Political assumptions -- all hierarchical social structures are not despotic top-down rule. Democracies can also be very hierarchical. Matter of scale rather than political system @graeber2021. But, tendencies?

-   Nested and non-nested social hierarchies, hierarchical hunter-gatherers? @hamilton2007, @whitridge2016

-   Biologically defined thresholds to group size? Dunbar's number and controversies, @dunbar2022, @west2023 (add published papers). Scalar stress @johnson1982, @alberti2014, @zhou2005

## Social typologies and their critique

-   Tools for classifying societies, or evolutionary model? Discussion of @johnson1987, @testart2005, @service1971

-   Critique in @yoffee1993, @yoffee2005, @graeber2021 ++

## Possible reasons for house-size difference

Often underlying assumptions: household wealth or size? Or both?

-   Kinship and households: who lives in a house? @sahlins2013, @ensor2013, @ensor2017

-   Do clan leaders have bigger houses?

Discuss some archaeo references

Functional difference:

-   Ethnography of initiation houses, communal/assembly houses, ritual houses, including @barley2011, @godelier1986, @wilk1983, @fraser1968

-   Caveats: building materials and constraints

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms

-   Power-law distributions, hierarchy and scale invariance.

-   Normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.

-   Exponential distributions and growth rates.

-   Combinations: Log-normal, stretched exponential, parabolic fractal
