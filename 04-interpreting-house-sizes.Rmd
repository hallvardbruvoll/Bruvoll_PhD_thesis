## Possible reasons for house-size difference

In Archaeology there are two recurrent and seemingly contradicting assumptions underlying interpretations of house-size differences within a society. In studies where the goal is to provide population size estimates, this is often calculated from total living area, adding together the areas of the houses in question, and multiplying by a mean value of surface per inhabitant (**give examples**). This mean value is generally obtained from multiple ethnographic parallels. With this assumption -- that every inhabitant requires a similar amount of living space (**mention actual values from literature**) -- the size of a house effectively results from its number of inhabitants. The second assumption, which is more frequently seen in studies focussing on wealth inequality and social stratification, is that house-size differences are expressions of differences in some sort of wealth or power (**give examples**). In this view, a larger house would have belonged to a wealthier household, capable of procuring more raw materials and activating a larger labour force for its construction and maintenance, in which case there would be significant disparities in living space per individual. Even though there is not necessarily any contradiction between these two interpretations from an anthropological point of view, most archaeologists seem to be unable to consider both simultaneously. From a methodological point of view, each of these assumptions will tend to mask our ability to see traces in the archaeological data relating to the other assumption -- that is, with existing methods we cannot convincingly provide estimations of both population size and level of social inequality from the same data, even though house sizes are the basis of both argumentations. Far from proposing a solution to this issue, my argument here is that a variety of social institutions known from ethnography and historical sources can explain a certain correlation between the two variables. Dowry and bride price are geographically and temporally widespread practices that link number of offspring (daughters, sons or both, depending on cases) with wealth (**citation needed?**). Clan leaders may draw upon kinship ties and dependencies in order to obtain the workforce needed to construct a larger house. Nevertheless, if the notion of wealth is at all to be applied meaningfully to non-capitalistic societies, it should designate cases where there is significant material disparities between members of a population, and not simply point to different household sizes. This would imply that there should be HMMM.

Discuss some archaeo references

-   Schiesberg 2010 2016, go through refs in Zotero, family size and houses for the LBK

Functional difference:

-   Ethnography of initiation houses, communal/assembly houses, ritual houses, including @barley2011, @godelier1986, @wilk1983, @fraser1968, @haude2019

-   Caveats: building materials and constraints, climate (heating), mobility, multi-floored, see @porcic2012 ++

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms

-   Power-law distributions, hierarchy and scale invariance.

Start here.

-   Normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.

-   Exponential distributions and growth rates.

-   Combinations: Log-normal, stretched exponential, parabolic fractal

-   Notes on terminology: Power law, Pareto and Zipf, @newman2005. Lack of consensus on notation, also for scaling parameter. Difference between PDF and CDF, continuous and discrete.

-   A law (distribution) is not a law (of nature), see @grove2011 for review of the long-lasting confusion in Archaeology (e.g. @hodder1979), also "rank-size rule"

## Fitting heavy-tailed distributions in Archaeology {#distfit-archaeo}

-   Lit. use @strawinska-zanko2018, @crabtree2017, @maschner2003, @grove2011 ++

-   Zipf law and Settlement Scaling theory, @bettencourt2021, @gomez-lievano2012, @lobo2020. Connection with Central Place Theory, e.g. @müller-scheeßel2007, @chen2011. Why I'm not doing settlement scaling in this study.

-   Not fitting distributions in Archaeology, just assuming they are heavy-tailed, or avoiding the question: ex. @brink2013 (could include lots more!)
