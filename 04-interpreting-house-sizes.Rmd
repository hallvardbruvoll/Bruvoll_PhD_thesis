## Possible reasons for house-size difference

In archaeology there are two recurrent and seemingly contradicting assumptions underlying interpretations of house-size differences within a society. In studies where the goal is to provide population size estimates, this is often calculated from total living area, adding together the areas of the houses in question, and multiplying by a mean value of surface per inhabitant (**give examples**). This mean value is generally obtained from multiple ethnographic parallels. With this assumption -- that every inhabitant requires a similar amount of living space (**mention actual values from literature**) -- the size of a house effectively reflects its number of inhabitants. The second assumption, which is more frequently seen in studies focussing on wealth inequality and social stratification, is that house-size differences are expressions of differences in some sort of wealth or power (**give examples**). In this view, a larger house would have belonged to a wealthier household, capable of procuring more raw materials and activating a larger labour force for its construction and maintenance, in which case there would be significant disparities in living space per individual. Even though there is not necessarily any contradiction between these two interpretations from an anthropological point of view, most archaeologists seem to be unable to consider both possibilities simultaneously. From a methodological point of view, each of these assumptions will tend to mask our ability to see traces in the archaeological data relating to the other assumption -- that is, with existing methods we cannot convincingly provide estimations of both population size and level of social inequality from the same data, even though house sizes frequently form the basis of both argumentations. Far from proposing a solution to this issue, my argument here is that a variety of social institutions known from ethnography and historical sources can explain a certain correlation between the two variables. Dowry and bride price are geographically and temporally widespread practices that link number of offspring (daughters, sons or both, depending on cultural context) with wealth (**citation needed?**). Clan leaders may draw upon kinship ties and dependencies in order to obtain the workforce needed to construct a larger house. Nevertheless, if the notion of wealth is at all to be applied meaningfully to non-capitalistic societies, it should designate cases where there is significant and persistent material disparities between members of a population, and not simply point to different household sizes. House sizes could thus potentially reflect a somewhat more complex culture-specific interplay between household size and wealth, meaning that for a given house size, one chould assume a range of possible values of the two parameters (**insert fig/illustration**). This relationship between household size, wealth and house size should be studied more in detail empirically through the available ethnographic data, rather than reducing this complexity to a mean surface area per inhabitant for the entire population. Such a study, however, lies beyond the scope of the present thesis. Here I will largely leave aside the question of population and household size, focussing on distribution types of house size data, arguing that the most unequal distribution type considered here -- the power-law distribution -- is unlikely to emerge only from random differences in household size and standard marital patterns, favouring thus interpretations relating to wealth and/or power differences.

Even if the goal here is not to investigate population sizes, the discussion above still begs the question of who we assume to be living in a house. The use of the word *house* is in itself indicative of an underlying assumption that the building in question was in use primarily for domestic purposes -- essentially, a fixed architectural unit where someone would spend their nights at least most of their time, and in many cases also cook and eat their main meal during the day -- though proving this directly is not always straightforward in archaeology. For the cultural contexts discussed here -- the Linear Pottery and Trypillia groups in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic -- there is however little evidence for buildings with specific non-domestic (e.g. economic, religious or administrative) purposes, with the probable exception of the so-called mega-structures or assembly houses in the Trypillia mega-sites, which are discussed more in detail below. This lack of evidence does not imply that there was no specialised economic, religious or administrative activity in these societies, as ethnography and history clearly shows that such activity must reach a high degree of specialisation before it materialises in distinct buildings devoted exclusively for these functions (**ref?**). Artisans, shamans and chiefs could be highly specialised but still perform their activity at their domestic home or more diffusely outdoors or without any fixed location (cite Costin ++). It is in any case of common usage to speak of houses when discussing architectural units in Neolithic Europe and other prehistoric contexts, maybe because of a lack of a better generic word, but this usage should not prevent archaeologists from recognising other non-domestic functions of buildings whenever there is evidence for it.

Mention *house societies* [@joyce2000, Bnf; @kuijt2018; @lévi-strauss1982]. I.e. House of Targaryen, Gryffindor, Davenport etc., social institution often linked to feudalism. Membership in a House is not ascribed solely on descent, alliance, residence etc. as in more rigorously kinship-based societies, but on a more complex and fluid combination of these. Both House membership in general and rank within the House is typically subject to social competition through feasting or other demonstrations of good leadership skills.

Discuss some archaeo references

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms

-   Exponential distributions and growth rates.

-   Combinations: Log-normal, stretched exponential, parabolic fractal

-   Notes on terminology: Power law, Pareto and Zipf, @newman2005. Lack of consensus on notation, also for scaling parameter. Difference between PDF and CDF, continuous and discrete.

-   A law (distribution) is not a law (of nature), see @grove2011 for review of the long-lasting confusion in archaeology (e.g. @hodder1979), also "rank-size rule"
