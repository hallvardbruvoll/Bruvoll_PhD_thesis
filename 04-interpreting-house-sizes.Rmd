# (PART) Size distributions {.unnumbered}

# House sizes and social meaning {#house-sizes-theory}

## What is social hierarchy?

-   Political assumptions -- all hierarchical social structures are not despotic top-down rule. Democracies can also be very hierarchical. Matter of scale rather than political system @graeber2021. But, tendencies? Use @pumain2006, also furholt2020b.

-   Nested and non-nested social hierarchies, hierarchical hunter-gatherers? @hamilton2007, @whitridge2016 (or use in Chapter \@ref(disc-methods)?)

-   Biologically defined thresholds to group size? Dunbar's number and controversies, @dunbar2022, @west2023 (add published papers). Scalar stress @johnson1982, @alberti2014, @zhou2005

## Social typologies and their critique {#soc-typ}

-   Tools for classifying societies, or evolutionary model? Discussion of @johnson1987, @testart2005, @service1971, @earle1997.

-   Anti-evolution critique in @yoffee1993, @yoffee2005, @kienlin2012, @lund2022, @furholt2020. Anarchistic critique: @crumley1995, @haude2019, @graeber2021

## Possible reasons for house-size difference

Often underlying assumptions: household wealth or size? Or both?

-   Kinship and households: who lives in a house? @sahlins2013, @ensor2013, @ensor2017

-   Do clan leaders have bigger houses? check @haude2019

Discuss some archaeo references

Functional difference:

-   Ethnography of initiation houses, communal/assembly houses, ritual houses, including @barley2011, @godelier1986, @wilk1983, @fraser1968, @haude2019

-   Caveats: building materials and constraints

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms

-   Power-law distributions, hierarchy and scale invariance.

-   Normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.

-   Exponential distributions and growth rates.

-   Combinations: Log-normal, stretched exponential, parabolic fractal

-   Notes on terminology: Power law, Pareto and Zipf, @newman2005

-   A law (distribution) is not a law (of nature), see @grove2011 for review of the long-lasting confusion in Archaeology (e.g. @hodder1979), also "rank-size rule"

## Fitting heavy-tailed distributions in Archaeology {#distfit-archaeo}

-   Lit. use @strawinska-zanko2018, @crabtree2017, @maschner2003, @grove2011 ++

-   Zipf law and Settlement Scaling theory, @bettencourt2021, @gomez-lievano2012, @lobo2020. Connection with Central Place Theory, e.g. @müller-scheeßel2007, @chen2011. Why I'm not doing settlement scaling in this study.
