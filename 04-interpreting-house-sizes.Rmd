# (PART) Size distributions {.unnumbered}

# House sizes and social meaning {#house-sizes-theory}

## Possible reasons for house-size difference

Often underlying assumptions: household wealth or size? Or both?

-   Kinship and households: who lives in a house? @sahlins2013, @ensor2013, @ensor2017. @blanton1994. @carpenter2022

-   Do clan leaders have bigger houses? check @haude2019, check @carsten1995

Discuss some archaeo references

-   Schiesberg 2010 2016, go through refs in Zotero, family size and houses for the LBK

Functional difference:

-   Ethnography of initiation houses, communal/assembly houses, ritual houses, including @barley2011, @godelier1986, @wilk1983, @fraser1968, @haude2019

-   Caveats: building materials and constraints, climate (heating), mobility, multi-floored, see @porcic2012 ++

## Interpreting distribution types and their underlying mechanisms

-   Power-law distributions, hierarchy and scale invariance.

Start here.

-   Normal distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.

-   Exponential distributions and growth rates.

-   Combinations: Log-normal, stretched exponential, parabolic fractal

-   Notes on terminology: Power law, Pareto and Zipf, @newman2005. Lack of consensus on notation, also for scaling parameter. Difference between PDF and CDF, continuous and discrete.

-   A law (distribution) is not a law (of nature), see @grove2011 for review of the long-lasting confusion in Archaeology (e.g. @hodder1979), also "rank-size rule"

## Fitting heavy-tailed distributions in Archaeology {#distfit-archaeo}

-   Lit. use @strawinska-zanko2018, @crabtree2017, @maschner2003, @grove2011 ++

-   Zipf law and Settlement Scaling theory, @bettencourt2021, @gomez-lievano2012, @lobo2020. Connection with Central Place Theory, e.g. @müller-scheeßel2007, @chen2011. Why I'm not doing settlement scaling in this study.

-   Not fitting distributions in Archaeology, just assuming they are heavy-tailed, or avoiding the question: ex. @brink2013 (could include lots more!)
