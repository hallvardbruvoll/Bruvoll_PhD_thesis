# Discussion: Fractal Analysis and Archaeological data {#disc-methods}

fdsasdf

Also mention here fractals or related concepts used as a metaphor, with no mathematics involved [e.g. @chapman2006; @sherratt2004; @sindb√¶k2022; @whitridge2016].

## Distribution fitting

-   Multiplicative processes: power laws vs. log-normal, long debates [e.g. @harrison1981, @sheridan2018]. Does it really matter in the end?

## Image analysis

fdsa

The relationship between image density (built-up area) and fractal dimension was evaluated by @thomas2007, where they showed that these two parameters, under certain conditions (constant observation window, prefactor values close to 1), are exponentially correlated. They furthermore showed that observation window size and shape, as well as centroid placement, have little influence on *D*, while they have more influence on density when the pattern is not homogeneous. They do show, however, that images with the same density may have quite much variation in *D*, which is reflected in the layouts. Judging from their examples, more clustered layouts give higher *D* values, while more dispersed or dusty layouts give lower *D*, when density is constant. I ignore the use of prefactor values. According to @thomas2007, density is a crude measure of the overall intensity of the pattern, while fractal dimension is characterises the morphological structure, though it is not directly descriptive.
