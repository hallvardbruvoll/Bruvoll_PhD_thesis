# Material and data: social complexity in the European Neolithic

## Studying social complexity in Archaeology and Prehistory.

-   Grave goods

-   Burial monuments

-   The denominator problem

-   The use of ethnography

-   Other approaches (osteological, isotopes **refs**)

-   This project: house-size distributions and settlement layouts (details in subsequent chapters), just very short argumentation

## The Linear Pottery culture complex

-   General intro to the culture

-   The Žitava valley and research project

-   Organisation of Linear Pottery society: egalitarian or hierarchic?

## The Cucutení-Trypillia culture complex

-   General intro to the culture

-   The B2/C1 and the mega-sites of the Southern Bugh - Dnipro interfluve

## Reading site plans from geomagnetic imagery

## Synthetic data

-   And why I'm not (yet) relying on ethnographic data.

-   Don't go into technicalities here, just the reasoning.
