# (APPENDIX) Appendix {.unnumbered}

# Archaeological plan images {#append-archaeo}

The following plates include image series of archaeological settlement plans analysed in Chapter \@ref(images-results). The different image series are not to scale between them.

-   Settlements -- images are to scale within series

-   Quarters -- each plate is to scale internally, but not between each other

-   Time samples -- images are to scale within series

    -   Table \@ref(tab:append-time-tab) -- time samples, modelled sample dates and house orientations

See overview figures in Chapter \@ref(material) for absolute scales, and details on image preparation.

Original image files can be downloaded from project repository.

# Synthetic images {#append-synth}

The following plates contain the synthetic image series used for analysis in Chapter \@ref(images-methods), in the following order (plates are read row-wise from top left):

-   Variable image size and resolution -- pattern is zoomed in as the image gets larger

-   Variable image size and observation window -- as image gets larger, a larger extent of the pattern becomes visible; resolution stays the same

-   Variable resolution and observation window -- pattern is zoomed out as larger extent is included; image size is fixed

-   Variable image density (from here, image size, resolution and observation window are constant)

-   Variable size distribution of elements

-   Variable level of hierarchical clustering

-   Variable level of added random noise

See chapter text for details.

Original image files and R code for generating them can be downloaded from project repository.
