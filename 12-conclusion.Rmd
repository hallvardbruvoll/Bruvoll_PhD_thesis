# Conclusion and Outlook

## Things I would like to have done, but that didn't fit into this study
-   Ethnoarchaeology: Measure house sizes and settlement layouts in contemporary settings, and relate to social organisation (largely overlooked by ethnographers)
-   Test distributions and settlement layout analysis on other settings: Lake dwellings, later/historic periods, other materials (e.g. megaliths)... Add more complex distribution models, add observation windows on images. Try on remote sensing imagery.
-   Settlement Scaling on Neolithic settings
-   Time series: Hurst exponent and scale invariance in temporal development of e.g. regional settlement or population
-   Integrate -- bridge the gap -- between opposite theoretical (nat. and soc./hum.) approaches to the same phenomena
-   Chaos and strange attractors in Archaeology
-   More?
