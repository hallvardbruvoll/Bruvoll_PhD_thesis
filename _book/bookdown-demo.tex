\section{Background of the study}\label{background-of-the-study}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Studying social hierarchy in prehistory through fractal analysis of settlement plans
\item
  In Europe, the Neolithic is the long and messy transition period between mobile hunter-gatherer groups in the Palaeo- and Mesolithic, and the first city states in the Bronze (Aegean) and Iron Ages (Mediterranean and Central Europe)
\item
  Early farming economy, influence from the Near East.
\item
  Large variety in scale and content of archaeologically defined culture groups. Single farmsteads and small hamlets in many phases -- some with hardly any settlement evidence at all \textbf{examples mid-neo, use} Shennan (2018). Other phases include exceptionally large settlements, probably hosting populations of several thousand inhabitants, like at Maidanetske in central Ukraine around 3.800 BCE (see \ref{trypillia}). While in some settings, like in Linear Pottery society in much of continental Europe north of the Alps towards 5.100 BCE (see \ref{lbk}), the dead were buried in simple pit graves, with very little distinction in treatment between individuals, in other phases some individuals were buried with tremendous amounts of precious goods like in Varna, Romania, or under colossal burial mounds like in Carnac, France, both in the mid-5th millennium (Shennan, 2018)\textbf{check ref}.
\item
  Seen at a very large scale -- across the continent and through the Holocene -- the development of society from small scale and relatively egalitarian towards large scale and more hierarchical seems evident (though not to everyone, see Graeber \& Wengrow (2021) and Section \ref{soc-typ}). When we look more closely however, this evolution is anything but linear, as both population sizes and levels of hierarchical organisation seem to fluctuate considerably, sometimes over short time spans as from the Trypillia \textbf{C2 to D1??, check this}, when the so-called mega-sites are abandoned and their former inhabitants regroup into much smaller settlements during a transition of maybe only \textbf{check and ref} years.
\item
  In many cases, the level of social hierarchisation and complexity in a given Prehistoric society is very hard for researchers to evaluate, since many indicators of such structures are either lost from the archaeological record, or were never included in the first place {[}Perreault (2019); Section \ref{complexity-archaeo}{]}. Archaeological traces that are often interpreted as signs of social complexity and hierarchy may furthermore be deceiving. Seemingly monumental structures were in many cases built through small additions over centuries, rather than in one colossal construction campaign {[}\textbf{example, Carnac alignments? Danish megaliths?}{]}. In many megalithic burial contexts, it may be impossible to know how large a segment of the society that had access to such inhumations (\textbf{rephrase}).
\item
  New methods for investigating hierarchy: fractal analysis. Borrowed from other disciplines, not much tested in archaeology. Example from human geography, use:(Batty, 2005; Batty \& Longley, 1994; D'Acci, 2019; Jahanmiri \& Parker, 2022; Lagarias \& Prastacos, 2021; Tannier \& Pumain, 2005) (say what fractal analysis does, don't explain what it is here)(explain just the word fractal and cite section).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-question-and-objectives}{%
\section{Research question and objectives}\label{research-question-and-objectives}}

The overall goal of the present study is to test and assess the utility of fractal analysis techniques as tools for studying hierarchical social organisation in prehistoric societies. Two methodological approaches are under special scrutiny: the distribution fitting approach and the image analysis approach (C. T. Brown et al., 2005; C. Brown \& Liebovitch, 2010). These are applied to architectural data series from well-preserved and documented archaeological samples within Neolithic Linear Pottery and Trypillia contexts, as well as to synthetic data series. This thesis is thus not to be considered a culture-historic study of Linear Pottery or Trypillia society, but mainly a methodological study. However, results from the proposed analyses of these case studies may also contribute, as side-effects, to their respective fields of research.

For the distribution fitting approach, house-size distributions within settlements are modelled following a given procedure, and the retained model (the best fit) is interpreted in terms of social generating mechanisms. In particular, it is argued here that so-called power-law distributions reflect hierarchical structure, so that the identification of these within the studied samples may indicate the presence of some social hierarchisation process which warrants further interpretation.

With the image analysis approach, the spatial layouts of archaeological and synthetic settlement plans are analysed through the calculation of fractal dimension and lacunarity -- summary statistics which serve as quantifications of irregular spatial patterns or image textures. I argue here that geometrically irregular settlement plans are indicative of relative independence between households, while settlements that develop within geometrically regular grids indicate stronger overarching social structures, with a continuous range of possibilities in-between. The goal here is to test to which extent quantitative measures like fractal dimension and lacunarity may help differentiating between varying degrees of planning in prehistoric settlements.

While both these methodological approaches are well developed and integrated to other disciplines (e.g. Lagarias \& Prastacos, 2021), their usage in archaeology have so far remained anecdotal (Diachenko, 2018). A further overall goal of this thesis is to identify and explore possible limitations in the nature of archaeological data that may limit the applicability of fractal analysis methods within this discipline. For example, does fractal analysis of settlement plans require a data quality that would be practically unattainable in archaeological settings? But also inversely, as it is impossible to explore all potential applications within the framework of one doctoral thesis, suggestions for future research are provided in the last chapter.

\hypertarget{defining-hierarchies}{%
\section{Defining hierarchies}\label{defining-hierarchies}}

The term \emph{hierarchy} is central to the present study. Though commonly used in daily speech, defining the word is not as straight-forward as one might think, so some clarification on how it is understood here might be needed. In a volume dedicated to exploring the meanings and uses of hierarchy as a study object within a range of natural and social sciences, Denise Pumain provides a panorama of definition nuances, but also highlighting the characteristics that are commonly found in most cases (Pumain, 2006). Among these characteristics are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A pyramidal organisation of elements, ordered by a very unequal size distribution of a certain quality or variable, from a few large elements on top to many small elements at the bottom
\item
  When seen as a system, the whole is constituted of sub-systems, which are again constituted of sub-sub-systems, and so forth. These can either be ordered into clearly distinguished levels (stratified), or in other cases be scaled in a continuum (branched or tree structure)
\item
  In physical, biological and social hierarchical systems, the structure is often accompanied by a flow of energy, material, information or control in one or both directions between the top and bottom levels
\end{itemize}

Hierarchies are found in humanly constructed classification and taxonomical systems, where morphological distinctions are considered more important or fundamental at the higher end of the hierarchy, while being more detailed or specific at the lower end. Many hierarchical social systems, like religious (from Greek \emph{hieros} -- sacred, and \emph{archê} -- government), military or corporate organisations, include strongly reinforced regulations of subordination, which in modern society has led to somewhat negative connotations to both hyper-rational and despotic rule(\textbf{pumain2006:5-6?}). While one prevalent explanation for the frequency of hierarchical structures in nature and society is indeed that they ``represent the best solution for many optimisation problems'' (\emph{ibid}.:7), that does in no way mean they need to be consciously planned. On the contrary, in most cases hierarchies seem to emerge spontaneously, often from growth processes with systems splitting into sub-systems once they reach a certain critical size limit. There is also no compulsory link between social hierarchies and despotism, as it matters little to the overall structure whether the top element is elected for a limited period or born into an inherited leading position. More detail on how hierarchical structures emerge and how they can be described as fractals, is given in Chapter \ref{theory}. A further discussion on the specifics of social hierarchies is given below in Section \ref{social-hierarchy}, and on the differences between spontaneously emergent versus consciously planned structures in Chapter \ref{images-theory}.

A possible confusion with a somewhat different meaning of the term hierarchy should however be mentioned already here. If hierarchical structures are abundant in nature in both physical (inert) and biological systems, social hierarchies on the other hand -- understood as intra-species populations of individuals organised in pyramidal hierarchical, i.e.~multi-level relationships to each other -- seems to be almost exclusively found among human groups. At the same time, a different type of hierarchy is frequently described by biologists which is common among animals, namely \emph{dominance hierarchies}, also known as pecking order (Strauss et al., 2022). These structures are hierarchical in the sense that there is difference in rank between group members, and they also seem to emerge spontaneously in the animal populations where they are described. But unlike social hierarchies, these are purely \emph{linear}, in the sense that each group member is situated in rank above one part of the group and below the rest, so that the whole group forms a rank chain in the form A \textgreater{} B \textgreater{} C \ldots{} n.~The rank of an individual will typically decide their access to food and reproduction relative to the other members, and may be settled and resettled in a number of ways depending on the species and population under study, but typically involving some level of violence or threat and subordination in face-to-face encounters (Strauss et al., 2022).

A classic example -- perhaps most of all in popular culture -- is dominance hierarchy among wolves, led by an alpha male (e.g. Cafazzo et al., 2016; Packard, 2003). Though it has been much discussed whether or not this trope model actually fits wolves (see Mech, 1999; Muro et al., 2011), any reported dominance hierarchies among larger groups of wolves and stray dogs are linear rather than pyramidal, even when they are illustrated as pyramidal (e.g.~Fig.1 in Rodríguez et al., 2017). Similar social organisation systems are found among a wide variety of species -- mammals, birds, fish, particularly but not only among group-hunting carnivores -- and are generally interpreted as an evolutionary mechanism (Strauss et al., 2022, with references). Cases of branching, multi-level social hierarchies among animals are on the other hand extremely rare, but have been reported to operate among hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, with ``clan leaders'' forming relays of information flow and decision making between the ``one-male units'' within a total population (``band'') of about 200 individuals (Schreier \& Swedell, 2009). Eusocial insects like ants and wasps provide a more well-known example of hierarchical organisation among animals (Shimoji \& Dobata, 2022), also indicating -- if it should be necessary -- that it is not a matter of cognitive abilities or brain size, but rather of social function (e.g.~building a hive or a village together) and population size above a certain threshold.

The reason to dwell upon this qualitative distinction between linear and pyramidal hierarchies, is that the prevalence of the former in nature is sometimes put forward as an argument for social hierarchies among hunter-gatherer groups in the Palaeo- and Mesolithic {[}find precise reference here --\textgreater{} Graeber, if else strawman, Hayden 2007, pp.~231-6{]} \textbf{fill in this one}. While it is a good point that there is no reason there couldn't be linear dominance hierarchies among small forager groups, and that such systems hardly can be described as egalitarian by those who live them, we cannot assume that pyramidal social hierarchies have always been part of human culture, but rather that they -- much like agriculture -- at some point came to be as historical phenomena.

Bottom line hierarchy: pecking order/linear dominance hierarchy may be prevalent in any part of human prehistory, but could also be very hard to study from material remains. Branching (i.e.~fractal) hierarchies as well as social stratification should leave material traces, and are most probably related to population size (see below), and thus less likely to be found within pre-Neolithic societies. They should be regarded as historically situated phenomenons -- much like agriculture, pottery, writing or the steam engine -- justifying the search for and explanation of their possible origins (\emph{contra} e.g. Graeber \& Wengrow, 2021). The issue of the universality or particularity of social inequality and hierarchy is discussed in more detail \textbf{in the final chapters of this thesis (specify).}

\section{Structure of the thesis}\label{structure-of-the-thesis}}

This thesis is structured as a monograph in four parts. In the first part the overall framework of the study is exposed, with the general introduction above, the overarching theoretical framework in Chapter \ref{theory}, and the background of the study material in Chapter \ref{material}. Parts II and III are devoted to each their methodological approach to the material: Part II to the study of hierarchy in size distributions, and Part III to the quantification of image textures. Each of these parts consists of three chapters, the first of which -- Chapters \ref{house-sizes-theory} and \ref{images-theory} -- exposes the theoretical and interpretative background of the applied methods and their relevance to archaeology. The following chapters -- Chapters \ref{methods-distfit} and \ref{images-methods} -- detail the technical specifics of the two approaches and their implementation in this study, and the last chapters within these parts -- Chapters \ref{results-distfit} and \ref{images-results} -- provide the actual analyses and summaries of results. In Part IV, the findings are summarised and further discussed. Chapter \ref{disc-results} gives an attempt of interpreting the results in the context of the culture-historical setting of the European Neolithic, while Chapter \ref{disc-methods} reviews the possibilities and limitations of the fractal analysis framework in archaeology. Concluding remarks and suggestions for further study are given in Chapter \ref{conclusion}.

Some readers might react to an apparent deviation from the academic tradition of devoting a separate chapter to research history. This is a deliberate choice, not to suggest that historiography is unimportant, but rather as a result of the fundamentally interdisciplinary scope of the study. In fact, there is very little extant history of applying fractal analysis in archaeology -- the few studies that, to my knowledge, have been done in this direction are discussed primarily in Sections \ref{distfit-archaeo} and \ref{image-archaeo}. Fractal analysis itself holds a research history of its own (see Section \ref{fractals}), and so does the study of Linear Pottery (Section \ref{lbk}) and Trypillia societies (Section \ref{trypillia}), not to mention the general study of social complexity in prehistory (mainly Section \ref{complexity-archaeo}). In short, instead of trying to shoehorn these parallel histories into a clearly delimited but rather hybrid chapter, I have opted for what I believe to be a more useful approach, namely to fit them in more seamlessly where they belong, in the various associated theory and methods chapters.

An additional note should be made here regarding the writing style of the different parts and chapters. It is my belief that a major obstacle for fractal analysis methods to become more integrated into the standard tool kits of archaeological research, is the excessively technical nature of much of the associated literature. archaeology as a discipline remains profoundly rooted in the Humanities, as seen in the inbuilt structure of teaching, research and funding institutions in most (at least European) countries. Fractal analysis is derived from pure mathematics, and most applications so far have been developed within the natural sciences (\textbf{ref necessary?}). Archaeologists who are trained within a humanistic scholarly tradition cannot be expected to hold a skill level of mathematics more advanced than what is achieved in high school, and code programming is hardly taught at all within the walls of Humanities faculties. Technical details regarding the methods and analyses applied in this thesis are therefore -- as much as possible -- limited to the devoted Chapters \ref{methods-distfit} and \ref{images-methods}, and readers who are interested in these may also refer to the online code repository for more details and reproducibility \textbf{cite repository}. In the rest of the thesis I have opted for a more narrative approach, in an attempt to invite a somewhat larger audience of archaeologists into the fascinating complexities of fractals.

Social complexity is more than social hierarchy, and all societies -- whether they are classified as simple or complex within a social evolutionary framework -- can arguably be studied as complex systems, since they always consist of various sub-systems and populations of individuals acting and interacting in a variety of ways (Daems, 2021, p. 6). The sense of social complexity that is traditionally understood in archaeology, derived from social evolution theory, is somewhat narrower and relates more to the specific characteristics of organisational scale (i.e.~hierarchy) than to complexity per se. Studying the scale of social organisation from a complex systems perspective rather than from a social evolutionist one holds several advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The switch from discrete evolutionary stages to continuous spectra allows for more nuanced evaluation of the society in question, avoiding false binaries like simple-complex
\item
  The complex systems approach arguably has a stronger explanatory power than the more classificatory social evolution schemes
\item
  Complexity theory offers a better alternative for ethical reasons, as it avoids the underlying colonial and eurocentric connotations associated with classifying societies into simple and complex
\end{enumerate}

As a further elaboration on the latter point, an analysis of a society from a complexity theoretical viewpoint is not a matter of establishing whether or not the society can be characterised as a complex system. When the scale of social organisation is the object of study -- as in the present thesis -- the word hierarchy is both more accurate and, if not neutral, at least more balanced than social complexity, since it is not obvious whether or not it is a good thing for a society to be characterised as hierarchical. The study of the dynamics of social hierarchy over time is thus not a story of progress, as the 19th century studies of social evolution too often were.

The term \emph{fractal} was pinned by the French-American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2010), from the latin word \emph{fractus} meaning broken or irregular, to describe patterns that because of their apparent limitless complexity defied concise description within the framework of Euclidean geometry (Falconer \& Falconer, 2013, pp. 116--120). Such patterns -- both theoretical and empirical -- had been described and analysed by mathematicians and researchers within other disciplines since the end of the 19th century, but were mostly regarded as curiosities and exceptions, and Mandelbrot was the first to link all these previous studies within a unified theoretical framework (B. B. Mandelbrot, 2021, 1975).

In one influential paper, drawing on previous work by mathematician Lewis Fry Richardson, B. Mandelbrot (1967) argued that a rugged linear feature like a coastline cannot be fully described through traditional geometry with a set of line segments, since this would result in a curve of infinite complexity. More importantly, he showed that the traditional measure of lines -- the length -- will inevitably depend on the scale of observation when applied to a coastline. If measured in kilometres, a coastline will always appear shorter in total length, than if it is measured in metres, since smaller bays and inlets can then also be accounted for. But this phenomenon continues seemingly without limit, since the same coastline measured in centimetres will appear much longer, and in millimetres far longer again, and so on. Length as a measure of rugged linear features thus seems inadequate, which may become a problem in practical settings when comparing coastlines between countries that operate with different measurement units and procedures. The same problem occurs when describing irregular patterns in the plane (like island or continent outlines) with area or in three-dimensional space (like clouds or galaxies) with volume. As a solution, Mandelbrot proposed the use of the \emph{fractal dimension} as a descriptive tool for characterising such patterns.

\end{itemize}

For this project I opted for the use of houses and built environments as proxy for social hierarchy. In this way I hope to largely avoid the denominator problem associated with burials. While it is true that for many archaeological culture groups in late prehistory habitats are poorly preserved and hard to discover, leaving us still with a limited understanding of them (the case in many Michelsberg, Corded Ware and Bell Beaker groups, only to mention a few \textbf{check}), in groups where habitats are well preserved, there is little reason to suspect that the available record would not cover the whole range of social statuses if these societies were hierarchical. Unlike burials, every individual in a sedentary society -- with few exceptions like homeless persons in more recent urban contexts -- will normally have at least one fixed place to stay overnight, and these homes will in most cases be constructed within the same fundamental framework of techniques and building materials, depending more on culture specific traditions and environmental factors than on social status (\textbf{citation?}). As an example, in a society where mudbrick is the main building material, like in the Neolithic Near East and Anatolia, nearly all constructions are made in mudbrick, regardless of the social status of the inhabitants. In Europe north of the Alps, wattle-and-daub construction was the almost exclusive building technique for any architectural feature from the early Neolithic until the Roman conquest, and well into the Middle Ages north of the \emph{limes}. One can of course enumerate exceptions, but more importantly houses are in any stratified society also a marker of social status, which can be exhibited in a range of ways, from decorations, use of more precious raw materials as well as size. That is precisely the reason for using houses as a proxy for social status and hierarchy in archaeological settings. But the point here is that there should be little taphonomic differentiation between groups of high and low status within a given archaeological context, at least in prehistory, and at least not as much as can be expected for burials, meaning that we can expect to find samples of houses that are representative of the social structure of the archaeological culture in question. On sites where there is taphonomical loss of architectural structures, as long as the overall building tradition is homogeneous, there is no reason this loss should affect one segment of the society more or less than others.

Some caveats do remain, however, for the use of houses as proxy of social status. Firstly, there may be a documentation bias favouring larger houses, since they may be easier to discover both during excavation and in remote-sensing surveys (\textbf{citation?}). In samples with very skewed house-size distributions, there may also be a further taphonomic bias towards large houses, since smaller houses -- being far more numerous -- are statistically in greater risk of being affected by post-depositional disturbances. Both of these biases are hard to evaluate empirically, though computer modelling could potentially give indications of their importance. This, however, is not within the scope of the present study.

A second, and maybe more important issue, is that of the contemporaneity of houses. When the goal is to investigate the social structure of a settlement as reflected in its architecture -- be it through the size distribution of buildings or their spatial layout -- all the analysed features should ideally have been in use at the same point in time. This is however very hard to achieve in most archaeological settings, and many researchers choose to either ignore the issue, or to accept a temporal resolution that is far wider than what their research questions should logically allow for (Perreault, 2019). One way of limiting this problem is to select study samples with little to no stratigraphic overlap, which might indicate short occupation span, though as shown below this indicator can also be deceiving. For both study areas selected for this thesis -- the Linear Pottery in south-west Slovakia and the B2/C1 Trypillia of central Ukraine -- settlement plans show very little overlap between houses, even though some of them probably developed over more than three centuries, as shown by radiocarbon dates and modelling (see below). Such settlement plans may be impossible to differentiate into separate coeval time samples without precise dating of construction and abandon of every individual house, counting in the thousands on the Trypillia mega-sites (an alternative method is presented only for the Linear Pottery settlements in Section \ref{lbk}). On the other hand, the fact that there is so little overlap between houses despite temporal differences clearly illustrates how these settlement plans emerged over time, not as a \emph{tabula rasa} in each generation but rather with new constructions respecting the location and orientation of older ones long after abandonment. Though such practices are indeed interesting, it is not at all obvious, however, to which extent they may reflect or even relate to social factors such as hierarchy. With settlement types with much higher degree of stratigraphic overlap, like the tell sites of the Balkan and Near Eastern Neolithic traditions, it may be easier to distinguish more or less coeval occupation phases, but they are again harder to document extensively -- because of the high density of archaeological finds and features, excavation surfaces typically cover only very small portions of the settlement, while remote sensing performs less well and not allowing for temporal disentanglement of constructed features (\textbf{citation}). In any case, the issue of temporal resolution of the data and its influence on analytical results is crucial, and will be discussed repeatedly throughout this thesis, with a summary in Chapter \ref{disc-methods}.

\section{Possible reasons for house-size difference}\label{possible-reasons-for-house-size-difference}}

In archaeology there are two recurrent and seemingly contradicting assumptions underlying interpretations of house-size differences within a society. In studies where the goal is to provide population size estimates, this is often calculated from total living area, adding together the areas of the houses in question, and multiplying by a mean value of surface per inhabitant (\textbf{give examples}). This mean value is generally obtained from multiple ethnographic parallels. With this assumption -- that every inhabitant requires a similar amount of living space (\textbf{mention actual values from literature}) -- the size of a house effectively reflects its number of inhabitants. The second assumption, which is more frequently seen in studies focussing on wealth inequality and social stratification, is that house-size differences are expressions of differences in some sort of wealth or power (\textbf{give examples}). In this view, a larger house would have belonged to a wealthier household, capable of procuring more raw materials and activating a larger labour force for its construction and maintenance, in which case there would be significant disparities in living space per individual. Even though there is not necessarily any contradiction between these two interpretations from an anthropological point of view, most archaeologists seem to be unable to consider both possibilities simultaneously. From a methodological point of view, each of these assumptions will tend to mask our ability to see traces in the archaeological data relating to the other assumption -- that is, with existing methods we cannot convincingly provide estimations of both population size and level of social inequality from the same data, even though house sizes frequently form the basis of both argumentations. Far from proposing a solution to this issue, my argument here is that a variety of social institutions known from ethnography and historical sources can explain some level of correlation between the two variables. Dowry and bride price are geographically and temporally widespread practices that link number of offspring (daughters, sons or both, depending on cultural context) with wealth. Clan leaders may draw upon kinship ties and dependencies in order to obtain the workforce needed to construct a larger house (\textbf{citation needed}). Nevertheless, if the notion of wealth is at all to be applied meaningfully to non-capitalistic societies, it should designate cases where there is significant and persistent material disparities between members of a population, and not simply point to different household sizes. House sizes could thus potentially reflect a somewhat more complex culture-specific interplay between household size and wealth, meaning that for a given house size, one could assume a range of possible values of the two parameters (\textbf{insert fig/illustration}). This relationship between household size, wealth and house size should be studied more in detail empirically through the available ethnographic data, rather than reducing its complexity to a mean surface area per inhabitant for the entire population. Such a study, however, lies beyond the scope of the present thesis. Here I will largely leave aside the question of population and household size, focussing on distribution types of house size data, arguing that the most unequal distribution type considered here -- the power-law distribution -- is unlikely to emerge only from random differences in household size and standard marital patterns, favouring thus interpretations relating to wealth and/or power differences.

Even though the goal here is not to investigate household sizes but to focus on the material aspect of house-size distributions, some fundamental issues of terminology should be addressed. The use of the word \emph{house} is indicative of an underlying assumption that the building in question was in use primarily for domestic purposes -- essentially, a fixed architectural unit where someone would spend their nights at least most of their time, and in many cases also cook and eat their main meal during the day -- though proving this directly is not always straightforward in archaeology. For the cultural contexts discussed here -- the Linear Pottery and Trypillia groups in the Neolithic-Chalcolithic -- there is however little evidence for buildings with specific non-domestic (e.g.~economic, religious or administrative) purposes, with the probable exception of the so-called mega-structures or assembly houses in the Trypillia mega-sites, which are discussed more in detail below. This lack of evidence does not imply that there was no specialised economic, religious or administrative activity in these societies, as ethnography and history clearly shows that such activity must reach a high degree of specialisation before it materialises in distinct buildings devoted exclusively for these functions (\textbf{refs? not Hendon 2007}). Artisans, shamans and chiefs could be highly specialised but still perform their activity at their domestic home or more diffusely outdoors or without any fixed location (cite Costin ++). It is in any case of common usage to speak of houses when discussing architectural units in Neolithic Europe and other prehistoric contexts, maybe because of a lack of a better generic word, but this usage should not prevent archaeologists from recognising other non-domestic functions of buildings whenever there is evidence for it. The \emph{household} is furthermore the designation of all the people, genealogically related or not, usually living under the same roof or within the same architectural unit, constituting a functional whole economically and socially.

A somewhat distinct meaning of the word house, which has had a certain success in archaeology, is derived from what Lévi-Strauss termed \emph{house societies} (Lévi-Strauss, 1982, \emph{sociétés à maisons}). Here a House (with a capital H) is a social unit, often centred around a material estate but also involving heirlooms, land ownership etc. and where membership is not automatically determined from genealogy alone, as is the case with more regularly structured lineage societies. House membership may be gained, and lost, through more competitive social action, privileging those that possess the resources to engage in activities such as gift exchange and \emph{potlatch}-style feasting. This opens up for more complex configurations, and House membership will often entail a certain level of prestige. A segment of society of varying size will not afford to partake in this competition, and as a result, house societies can be viewed as being in a somewhat unstable transition state between lineage and class societies. They are often however associated with feudal systems -- the most well-known examples from contemporary pop culture (House of Lannister, House of Gryffindor etc.) tend to mirror medieval European feudal society more or less explicitly. Lévi-Strauss based his initial analysis on \textbf{check} society, and the concept has since been applied to a wide range of cases from \textbf{insert examples} ethnography, as well as to prehistoric contexts \textbf{insert examples}, reflecting a relevance that extends far beyond European feudalism. Ian Kuijt (2018) recently provided an interpretation of Neolithic Çatalöyük where he proposed that

Lit. use Furholt (2016), Fraser (1968), Ensor et al. (2017) (not the correct reference, I should ask him!) Artursson et al. (2010) (Bronze Age, descriptive/interpretive approach). Cleuziou et al. (1999) (book in MAE)

Use the Trypillia volumes. Also Müller-Scheeßel (2019), Trebsche et al. (2010)

Transition from village to urban (again): Birch (2014).

Factors affecting village layout:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Political structure (but, as with hierarchy, an organised layout does not necessarily equate top-down despotic decision making).
\item
  Kinship, matrimonial and locality structures
\item
  Cosmology (e.g.~Linear Pottery house orientations)
\item
  Economic and ritual functions of village elements (constructed and non-constructed)
\item
  Local landscape setting (to be factored out)

  Euclid: grids, lines, circles -- how humans think in shapes. Social settings: architect/planner, strong common institutions/ideals (examples?)
\item
  Mandelbrot: irregular, self-similar, scale independent (i.e.~fractal) shapes -- emergent, not consciously preconceived. Self-organisation. Does the ``no pattern'' case exist? Emergence from repetitive sequences of simple choices/mechanisms. Examples.
\item
  Binary or continuum? Needs to be studied empirically.

\section{Synthetic settlement plans}\label{synthetic-settlement-plans}}

Relationship between image density (built-up area) and fractal dimension, evaluated in Thomas et al. (2007), where they show that these two parameters, under certain conditions (constant observation window, prefactor values close to 1), are exponentially correlated, which is also what I found in my article. They show that observation window size and shape, as well as centroid placement, have little influence on \emph{D}, while they have more influence on density when the pattern is not homogeneous. They do show, however, that images with the same density may have quite much variation in \emph{D}, which is reflected in the layouts. Judging from their examples, more clustered layouts give higher \emph{D} values, while more dispersed or dusty layouts give lower \emph{D}, when density is constant. I ignore the use of prefactor values. According to Thomas et al. (2007), density is a crude measure of the overall intensity of the pattern, while fractal dimension is characterises the morphological structure, though it is not directly descriptive.

  Ethnoarchaeology: Measure house sizes and settlement layouts in contemporary settings, and relate to social organisation (largely overlooked by ethnographers)
\item
  Test distributions and settlement layout analysis on other settings: Lake dwellings, later/historic periods, other materials (e.g.~megaliths)\ldots{} Add more complex distribution models, add observation windows on images. Try on remote sensing imagery.
\item
  Settlement Scaling on Neolithic settings
\item
  Time series: Hurst exponent and scale invariance in temporal development of e.g.~regional settlement or population
