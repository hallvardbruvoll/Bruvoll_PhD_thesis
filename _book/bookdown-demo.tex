\section{Background of the study}\label{background-of-the-study}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Studying social hierarchy in Prehistory through fractal analysis of settlement plans
\item
  In Europe, the Neolithic is the long and messy transition period between mobile hunter-gatherer groups in the Palaeo- and Mesolithic, and the first city states in the Bronze (Aegean) and Iron Ages (Mediterranean and Central Europe)
\item
  Early farming economy, influence from the Near East.
\item
  Large variety in scale and content of archaeologically defined culture groups. Single farmsteads and small hamlets in many phases -- some with hardly any settlement evidence at all \textbf{examples mid-neo, use} Shennan (2018). Other phases include exceptionally large settlements, probably hosting populations of several thousand inhabitants, like at Maidanetske in central Ukraine around 3.800 BCE (see \ref{trypillia}). While in some settings, like in Linear Pottery society in much of continental Europe north of the Alps towards 5.100 BCE (see \ref{lbk}), the dead were buried in simple pit graves, with very little distinction in treatment between individuals, in other phases some individuals were buried with tremendous amounts of precious goods like in Varna, Romania, or under colossal burial mounds like in Carnac, France, both in the mid-5th millennium (Shennan 2018)\textbf{check ref}.
\item
  Seen at a very large scale -- across the continent and through the Holocene -- the development of society from small scale and relatively egalitarian towards large scale and more hierarchical seems evident (though not to everyone, see Graeber and Wengrow (2021) and Section \ref{soc-typ}). When we look more closely however, this evolution is anything but linear, as both population sizes and levels of hierarchical organisation seem to fluctuate considerably, sometimes over short time spans as from the Trypillia \textbf{C2 to D1??, check this}, when the so-called mega-sites are abandoned and their former inhabitants regroup into much smaller settlements during a transition of maybe only \textbf{check and ref} years.
\item
  In many cases, the level of social hierarchisation and complexity in a given Prehistoric society is very hard for researchers to evaluate, since many indicators of such structures are either lost from the archaeological record, or were never included in the first place {[}Perreault (2019); Section \ref{complexity-archaeo}{]}. Archaeological traces that are often interpreted as signs of social complexity and hierarchy may furthermore be deceiving. Seemingly monumental structures were in many cases built through small additions over centuries, rather than in one colossal construction campaign {[}\textbf{example, Carnac alignments? Danish megaliths?}{]}. In many megalithic burial contexts, it may be impossible to know how large a segment of the society that had access to such inhumations (\textbf{rephrase}).
\item
  New methods for investigating hierarchy: fractal analysis. Borrowed from other disciplines, not much tested in Archaeology. Example from human geography, use:(Batty 2005; Batty and Longley 1994; D'Acci 2019; Jahanmiri and Parker 2022; Lagarias and Prastacos 2021; Tannier and Pumain 2005) (say what fractal analysis does, don't explain what it is here)(explain just the word fractal and cite section).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{research-question-and-objectives}{%
\section{Research question and objectives}\label{research-question-and-objectives}}

The overall goal of the present study is to test and assess the utility of fractal analysis techniques as tools for studying hierarchical social organisation in prehistoric societies. Two methodological approaches are under special scrutiny: the distribution fitting approach and the image analysis approach (Brown and Liebovitch 2010; Brown, Witschey, and Liebovitch 2005). These are applied to architectural data series from well-preserved and documented archaeological samples within neolithic Linear Pottery and Trypillia contexts, as well as to synthetic data series. This thesis is thus not to be considered a culture-historic study of Linear Pottery or Trypillia society, but mainly a methodological study. However, results from the proposed analyses of these case studies may also contribute, as side-effects, to their respective fields of research.

For the distribution fitting approach, house-size distributions within settlements are modelled following a given procedure, and the retained model (the best fit) is interpreted in terms of social generating mechanisms. In particular, it is argued here that so-called power-law distributions reflect hierarchical structure, so that the identification of these within the studied samples may indicate the presence of some social hierarchisation process which warrants further interpretation.

With the image analysis approach, archaeological and synthetic settlement plans are analysed through the calculation of fractal dimension and lacunarity -- summary statistics which serve as quantifications of irregular spatial patterns or image textures. I argue here that geometrically irregular settlement plans are indicative of relative independence between households, while settlements that develop within geometrically regular grids indicate stronger overarching social structures, with a continuous range of possibilities in-between. The goal here is to test to which extent quantitative measures like fractal dimension and lacunarity may help differentiating between varying degrees of planning in prehistoric settlements.

While both these methodological approaches are well developed and integrated to other disciplines, their usage in Archaeology have so far remained anecdotal (Diachenko 2018). A further overall goal of this thesis is to identify and explore possible limitations in the nature of archaeological data that may limit the applicability of fractal analysis methods within this discipline. For example, does fractal analysis of settlement plans require a data quality that would be practically unattainable in archaeological settings? But also inversely, as it is impossible to explore all potential applications within the framework of one doctoral thesis, suggestions for future research are provided in the last chapter.

\hypertarget{structure-of-the-thesis}{%
\section{Structure of the thesis}\label{structure-of-the-thesis}}

This thesis is structured as a monograph in four parts. In the first part the overall framework of the study is exposed, with the general introduction above, the overarching theoretical framework in Chapter \ref{theory}, and the background of the study material in Chapter \ref{material}. Parts II and III are devoted to each their methodological approach to the material: Part II to the study of hierarchy in size distributions, and Part III to the quantification of image textures. Each of these parts consists of three chapters, the first of which -- Chapters \ref{house-sizes-theory} and \ref{images-theory} -- exposes the theoretical and interpretative background of the applied methods and their relevance to Archaeology. The following chapters -- Chapters \ref{methods-distfit} and \ref{images-methods} -- detail the technical specifics of the two approaches and their implementation in this study, and the last chapters within these parts -- Chapters \ref{results-distfit} and \ref{images-results} -- provide the actual analyses and summaries of results. In Part IV, the findings are summarised and further discussed. Chapter \ref{disc-results} gives an attempt of interpreting the results in the context of the culture-historical setting of the European Neolithic, while Chapter \ref{disc-methods} reviews the possibilities and limitations of the fractal analysis framework in Archaeology. Concluding remarks and suggestions for further study are given in Chapter \ref{conclusion}.

Some readers might react to an apparent deviation from the academic tradition of devoting a separate chapter to research history. This is a deliberate choice, not to suggest that historiography is unimportant, but rather as a result of the fundamentally interdisciplinary scope of the study. In fact, there is very little extant history of applying fractal analysis in Archaeology -- the few studies that, to my knowledge, have been done in this direction are discussed primarily in Sections \ref{distfit-archaeo} and \ref{image-archaeo}. Fractal analysis itself holds a research history of its own (see Section \ref{fractals}), and so does the study of Linear Pottery (Section \ref{lbk}) and Trypillia societies (Section \ref{trypillia}), not to mention the general study of social complexity in Prehistory (mainly Section \ref{complexity-archaeo}). In short, instead of trying to shoehorn these parallel histories into a clearly delimited but rather hybrid chapter, I have opted for what I believe to be a more useful approach, namely to fit them in more seamlessly where they belong, in the various associated theory and methods chapters.

An additional note should be made here regarding the writing style of the different parts and chapters. It is my belief that a major obstacle for fractal analysis methods to become more integrated into the standard tool kits of archaeological research, is the excessively technical nature of much of the associated literature. Archaeology as a discipline remains profoundly rooted in the Humanities, as seen in the inbuilt structure of teaching, research and funding institutions in most (at least European) countries. Fractal analysis is derived from pure mathematics, and most applications so far have been developed within the natural sciences (\textbf{ref necessary?}). Archaeologists who are trained within a humanistic scholarly tradition cannot be expected to hold a skill level of mathematics more advanced than what is achieved in high school, and code programming is hardly taught at all within the walls of Humanities faculties. Technical details regarding the methods and analyses applied in this thesis are therefore -- as much as possible -- limited to the devoted Chapters \ref{methods-distfit} and \ref{images-methods}, and readers who are interested in these may also refer to the online code repository for more details and reproducibility \textbf{cite repository}. In the rest of the thesis I have opted for a more narrative approach, in an attempt to invite a somewhat larger audience of archaeologists into the fascinating complexities of fractals.

\tightlist
\item
  Cascading bifurcations and confluences (splitting or merging - tree structure/arborescence/branching, and relation to size. Terminology borrowed from biology and fluid dynamics (including turbulence/turbulent flow)
\end{itemize}

The role of randomness - tidy and messy fractals (romanesco broccolis are not more fractal than regular broccolis, only more regular.

The relationship with criticality and chaos: deterministic \emph{and} unpredictable

Fractals embedded in

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Space (hence ``fractal geometry''): geomorphology, plants, ocean and wind currents, galaxies, also human constructed features (see Chapter xx for details)
\item
  Time series: earthquakes, finance (not applied in this study, though should be done later)

Fractal analysis for studying irregular phenomena (methods described in more detail Chapters xxx), and thus as a tool for quantitative empirical research.

\item
  Nested and non-nested social hierarchies, hierarchical hunter-gatherers? Hamilton et al. (2007), Whitridge (2016) (or use in Chapter \ref{disc-methods}?)
\item
  Biologically defined thresholds to group size? Dunbar's number and controversies, Dunbar (2022), West et al. (2023) (add published papers). Scalar stress Johnson (1982), Alberti (2014), Zhou et al. (2005)

    \begin{enumerate}

      Temporal resolution issue: does the temporal palimpsest of several phases with e.g.~log-normal distributions produce false power-law signals?

    How?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist

Use the Trypillia volumes. Also Müller-Scheeßel (2019), Trebsche, Müller-Scheeβel, and Reinhold (2010)

Factors affecting village layout:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Political structure (but, as with hierarchy, an organised layout does not necessarily equate top-down despotic decision making).
\item
  Kinship, matrimonial and locality structures
\item
  Cosmology (e.g.~Linear Pottery house orientations)
\item
  Economic and ritual functions of village elements (constructed and non-constructed)

  Local landscape setting (to be factored out)

\item
  Euclid: grids, lines, circles -- how humans think in shapes. Social settings: architect/planner, strong common institutions/ideals (examples?)
\item
  Mandelbrot: irregular, self-similar, scale independent (i.e.~fractal) shapes -- emergent, not consciously preconceived. Self-organisation. Does the ``no pattern'' case exist? Emergence from repetitive sequences of simple choices/mechanisms. Examples.
\item
  Binary or continuum? Needs to be studied empirically.

\item
  Ethnoarchaeology: Measure house sizes and settlement layouts in contemporary settings, and relate to social organisation (largely overlooked by ethnographers)
\item
  Test distributions and settlement layout analysis on other settings: Lake dwellings, later/historic periods, other materials (e.g.~megaliths)\ldots{} Add more complex distribution models, add observation windows on images. Try on remote sensing imagery.
\item
  Settlement Scaling on Neolithic settings
\item
  Time series: Hurst exponent and scale invariance in temporal development of e.g.~regional settlement or population
\item
  Integrate -- bridge the gap -- between opposite theoretical (nat. and soc./hum.) approaches to the same phenomena
\item
  Chaos and strange attractors in Archaeology
\item
  More?
