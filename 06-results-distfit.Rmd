# Results: Distribution fitting {#results-distfit}

## Synthetic distributions

Fill in analysis for

1.  Multiplicative process

A multiplicative process is one where a term is multiplied with itself a number of times, resulting in an exponential distribution $f(x) ∝ 𝜆^x$,

1.  Additive process

## Settlements

House-size distributions of whole settlements (both Linear Pottery and Trypillia)

## Quarters/neighbourhoods

House-size distributions of separate quarters (Nebelivka) and neighbourhoods (Vráble). Can I include separate Nebelivka neighbourhoods as well? (prob. too small, but check)

## Temporal samples (Vráble)

If time, I can add more Žitava sites here, but not necessary. I can also analyse temporal samples of Vráble neighbourhoods separately.

## Summary of findings
