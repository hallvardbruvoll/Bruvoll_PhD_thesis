# Results: Distribution fitting

## Synthetic distributions

Fill in analysis for

1.  Multiplicative process

2.  Additive process

## Settlements

House-size distributions of whole settlements (both Linear Pottery and Trypillia)

## Quarters/neighbourhoods

House-size distributions of separate quarters (Nebelivka) and neighbourhoods (Vráble). Can I include separate Nebelivka neighbourhoods as well? (prob. too small, but check)

## Temporal samples (Vráble)

If time, I can add more Žitava sitesre, but not necessary. I can also analyse temporal samples of Vráble neighbourhoods separately.

## Summary of findings
