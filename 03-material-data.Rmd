# Material and data: social complexity in the European Neolithic {#material}

## Studying social hierarchy in archaeology and prehistory. {#complexity-archaeo}

-   Grave goods

-   Burial monuments

-   The denominator problem

-   The use of ethnography

-   Other approaches (osteological, isotopes, craft specialisation **refs**)

-   This project: house-size distributions and settlement layouts (details in subsequent chapters), just very short argumentation.

-   Comparative approach: Neolithic technology (not bronze axes), wood and wattle-and-daub architecture, (near) complete settlement plans/extensive documentation

For this project I opted for the use of houses and built environments as proxy for social hierarchy. In this way I hope to largely avoid the denominator problem associated with burials. While it is true that for many archaeological culture groups in late prehistory habitats are poorly preserved and hard to discover, leaving us still with a limited understanding of them (the case in many Michelsberg, Corded Ware and Bell Beaker groups, only to mention a few **check**), in groups where habitats are well preserved, there is little reason to suspect that the available record would not cover the whole range of social statuses if these societies were hierarchical. Unlike burials, every individual in a sedentary society -- with few exceptions like homeless persons in more recent urban contexts -- will normally have at least one fixed place to stay overnight, and these homes will in most cases be constructed within the same fundamental framework of techniques and building materials, depending more on culture specific traditions and environmental factors than on social status (**citation?**). As an example, in a society where mudbrick is the main building material, like in the Neolithic Near East and Anatolia, nearly all constructions are made in mudbrick, regardless of the social status of the inhabitants. In Europe north of the Alps, wattle-and-daub construction was the almost exclusive building technique for any architectural feature from the early Neolithic until the Roman conquest, and well into the Middle Ages north of the *limes*. One can of course enumerate exceptions, but more importantly houses are in any stratified society also a marker of social status, which can be exhibited in a range of ways, from decorations, use of more precious raw materials as well as size. That is precisely the reason for using houses as a proxy for social status and hierarchy in archaeological settings. But the point here is that there should be little taphonomic differentiation between groups of high and low status within a given archaeological context, at least in prehistory, and at least not as much as can be expected for burials, meaning that we can expect to find samples of houses that are representative of the social structure of the archaeological culture in question. On sites where there is taphonomical loss of architectural structures, as long as the overall building tradition is homogeneous, there is no reason this loss should affect one segment of the society more or less than others.

Some caveats do remain, however, for the use of houses as proxy of social status. Firstly, there may be a documentation bias favouring larger houses, since they may be easier to discover both during excavation and in remote-sensing surveys (**citation?**). In samples with very skewed house-size distributions, there may also be a further taphonomic bias towards large houses, since smaller houses -- being far more numerous -- are statistically in greater risk of being affected by post-depositional disturbances. Both of these biases are hard to evaluate empirically, though computer modelling could potentially give indications of their importance. This, however, is not within the scope of the present study.

A second, and maybe more important issue, is that of the contemporaneity of houses. When the goal is to investigate the social structure of a settlement as reflected in its architecture -- be it through the size distribution of buildings or their spatial layout -- all the analysed features should ideally have been in use at the same point in time. This is however very hard to achieve in most archaeological settings, and many researchers choose to either ignore the issue, or to accept a temporal resolution that is far wider than what their research questions should logically allow for [@perreault2019]. One way of limiting this problem is to select study samples with little to no stratigraphic overlap, which might indicate short occupation span, though as shown below this indicator can also be deceiving. For both study areas selected for this thesis -- the Linear Pottery in south-west Slovakia and the B2/C1 Trypillia of central Ukraine -- settlement plans show very little overlap between houses, even though some of them probably developed over more than three centuries, as shown by radiocarbon dates and modelling (see below). Such settlement plans may be impossible to differentiate into separate coeval time samples without precise dating of construction and abandon of every individual house, counting in the thousands on the Trypillia mega-sites (an alternative method is presented only for the Linear Pottery settlements in Section \@ref(lbk)). On the other hand, the fact that there is so little overlap between houses despite temporal differences clearly illustrates how these settlement plans emerged over time, not as a *tabula rasa* in each generation but rather with new constructions respecting the location and orientation of older ones long after abandonment. Though such practices are indeed interesting, it is not at all obvious, however, to which extent they may reflect or even relate to social factors such as hierarchy. With settlement types with much higher degree of stratigraphic overlap, like the tell sites of the Balkan and Near Eastern Neolithic traditions, it may be easier to distinguish more or less coeval occupation phases, but they are again harder to document extensively -- because of the high density of archaeological finds and features, excavation surfaces typically cover only very small portions of the settlement, while remote sensing performs less well and not allowing for temporal disentanglement of constructed features (**citation**). In any case, the issue of temporal resolution of the data and its influence on analytical results is crucial, and will be discussed repeatedly throughout this thesis, with a summary in Chapter \@ref(disc-methods).

Meaning of "house"

## The Linear Pottery culture complex {#lbk}

-   General intro to the culture

Formation, characteristics -- striking difference from earlier Mesolithic cultures, hence the term "Neolithic Revolution" pinned by Vere Gordon Childe for the seemingly abrupt transition to agriculture in continental Europe with what he called the Danubian Ia **ref**. @whittle2022, check with Trigger!

expansion trajectory: east: @saile2020,

Questions of contact and even creolisation with local hunter-gatherer groups in the margins of the Linear Pottery settlement area -- Limbourg and La Hoguette pottery groups in northern France and Belgium, Swifterbandt in the Netherlands??, Ertebølle in northern Germany??, Bug-Dniestr in Ukraine and Moldova [@saile2020] -- as well as with other already established Neolithic groups in central France [@roussot-larroque2022] and the lower Danube [@saile2020], remain hotly debated

Side note on Varna: Lichardus (1991; also Gimbutas), as discussed in @kadrow2013, proposed that the social inequality observed at Varna in the mid-5th millennium, was already then adopted from pastoral North Pontic steppe cultures (*check this and delete if unsure*); cf. @chapman2006 -- three social levels interpreted from grave goods, but not clear if these are really discrete or constructed on a continuum. The term *fractal* is here used purely as a metaphor for complex personhood structures, rather in opposition to the described social hierarchy.
