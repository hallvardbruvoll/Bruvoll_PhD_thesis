# Material and data: social complexity in the European Neolithic {#material}

## Studying social complexity in Archaeology and Prehistory. {#complexity-archaeo}

-   Grave goods

-   Burial monuments

-   The denominator problem

-   The use of ethnography

-   Other approaches (osteological, isotopes **refs**)

-   This project: house-size distributions and settlement layouts (details in subsequent chapters), just very short argumentation.

-   Comparative approach: Neolithic technology (not bronze axes), wood and wattle-and-daub architecture, (near) complete settlement plans/extensive documentation

## The Linear Pottery culture complex {#lbk}

-   General intro to the culture

-   Linear Pottery architecture and house construction

-   Organisation of Linear Pottery society: egalitarian or hierarchic?

-   The Žitava valley and research project

## The Cucutení-Trypillia culture complex {#trypillia}

-   General intro to the culture

-   Trypillia architecture and house construction

-   Trypillia social organisation: current debate

Side note on Varna: Lichardus (1991; also Gimbutas), as discussed in @kadrow2013, proposed that the social inequality observed at Varna in the mid-5th millennium, was already then adopted from pastoral North Pontic steppe cultures (*check this and delete if unsure*); cf. @chapman2006 -- three social levels interpreted from grave goods, but not clear if these are really discrete or constructed on a continuum. The term *fractal* is here used purely as a metaphor for complex personhood structures, rather in opposition to the described social hierarchy.

-   The B2/C1 and the mega-sites of the Southern Bugh -- Dnipro interfluve

## Reading site plans from geomagnetic imagery

-   Caveats: fill in here.

## Synthetic data

-   And why I'm not (this time) relying on ethnographic data.

-   Don't go into technicalities here, just the reasoning.
