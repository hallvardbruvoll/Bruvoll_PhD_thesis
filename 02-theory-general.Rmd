# Theoretical framework: Complexity and Fractals {#theory}

## Very short introduction to Complexity Theory / Dynamical Systems Theory

Lit. use @daems2021 and @bentley2007.

For Dynamical Systems, use @awrejcewicz2020 and @devaney2020, but don't go into detail.

Describe complexity, dynamical systems, chaos, feedback loops, criticality, emergence. Scale @west2017 NA

Mention the most common applications in Archaeology: ABMs, **and what**? check in literature.

## Very short introduction to Fractals and Fractal Analysis {#fractals}

Lit. use @mandelbrot2021, @falconer2013 (general), also @brown2010, @brown2005 and @diachenko2018 (for Archaeology)

Two sentences on history of fractals? Mandelbrot. Maybe cut?

Fractals as irregular patterns/structures

Fractals as hierarchy

Self-similarity and scale invariance

Processes/mechanisms that produce fractals:

-   Cascading bifurcations and confluences (splitting or merging - tree structure/arborescence/branching, and relation to size. Terminology borrowed from biology and fluid dynamics (including turbulence/turbulent flow)

The role of randomness - tidy and messy fractals (romanesco broccolis are not more fractal than regular broccolis, only more regular.

The relationship with criticality and chaos: deterministic *and* unpredictable

Fractals embedded in

-   Space (hence "fractal geometry"): geomorphology, plants, ocean and wind currents, galaxies, also human constructed features (see Chapter xx for details)

-   Time series: earthquakes, finance (not applied in this study, though should be done later)

-   Networks/abstract: hierarchical organisations, income distributions, word counts, 1/f or pink noise, www. etc. (see Chapter xxx for details)

-   Pure mathematics: Julia and Mandelbrot sets, strange attractors (don't go into details!)

No, not everything is fractal: e.g. Central Limit Theorem

Fractal analysis for studying irregular phenomena (methods described in more detail Chapters xxx), and thus as a tool for quantitative empirical research.

## Very short introduction to micro-macro approaches in social theory

-   LÃ©vi-Strauss and Structuralism

-   Giddens and Structuration Theory

-   Delanda and Assemblage Theory

-   Latour and Actor-Network Theory

What these approaches all have in common, is that they are entirely qualitative (**check**).

-   That's not a problem in itself.

-   Quant approach is both possible for the stated purpose, and desirable for reasons of comparative analysis.

-   Data deluge (refer to chap. on geomagn data). The goal here is to establish a quantitative framework for studying social complexity and hierarchy in archaeological/prehistoric settings. Further articulating fractal analysis with existing social theoretical approaches is not the primary goal here, as it could constitute a separate research project. In the present thesis, bla bla.

END chapter.

Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this[^02-theory-general-1].

[^02-theory-general-1]: where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^02-theory-general-2]

[^02-theory-general-2]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$
