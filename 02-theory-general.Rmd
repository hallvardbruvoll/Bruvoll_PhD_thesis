# Theoretical framework: Complexity and Fractals {#theory}

## Very short introduction to Complexity Theory / Dynamical Systems Theory

Lit. use @daems2021, @baden2016, @ross2017, @smith2011 and @bentley2008.

For Dynamical Systems, use @devaney2020, but don't go into detail.

Describe complexity, dynamical systems, chaos, feedback loops, criticality, emergence. Scale @west2017 NA

Social complexity is more than social hierarchy, and all societies -- whether they are classified as simple or complex within a social evolutionary framework -- can arguably be studied as complex systems, since they always consist of various sub-systems and populations of individuals acting and interacting in a variety of ways [@daems2021, p. 6]. The sense of social complexity that is traditionally understood in archaeology, derived from social evolution theory, is somewhat narrower and relates more to the specific characteristics of organisational scale (i.e. hierarchy) than to complexity per se. Studying the scale of social organisation from a complex systems perspective rather than from a social evolutionist one holds several advantages:

1.  The switch from discrete evolutionary stages to continuous spectra allows for more nuanced evaluation of the society in question, avoiding false binaries like simple-complex

2.  The complex systems approach arguably has a stronger explanatory power than the more classificatory social evolution schemes

3.  Complexity theory offers a better alternative for ethical reasons, as it avoids the underlying colonial and eurocentric connotations associated with classifying societies into simple and complex

As a further elaboration on the latter point, an analysis of a society from a complexity theoretical viewpoint is not a matter of establishing whether or not the society can be characterised as a complex system. When the scale of social organisation is the object of study -- as in the present thesis -- the word hierarchy is both more accurate and, if not neutral, at least more balanced than social complexity, since it is not obvious whether or not it is a good thing for a society to be characterised as hierarchical. The study of the dynamics of social hierarchy over time is thus not a story of progress, as the 19th century studies of social evolution too often were.

Mention the most common applications in archaeology, as discussed in @daems2021, p. 13: network science, settlement scaling, cultural evolution and agent-based modelling.

## Very short introduction to Fractals and Fractal Analysis {#fractals}

Lit. use @mandelbrot2021, @falconer2013 (general), also @brown2010, @brown2005 and @diachenko2018 (for archaeology)

The term *fractal* was pinned by the French-American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2010), from the latin word *fractus* meaning broken or irregular, to describe patterns that because of their apparent limitless complexity defied concise description within the framework of Euclidean geometry [@falconer2013, pp. 116-20]. Such patterns -- both theoretical and empirical -- had been described and analysed by mathematicians and researchers within other disciplines since the end of the 19th century, but were mostly regarded as curiosities and exceptions, and Mandelbrot was the first to link all these previous studies within a unified theoretical framework [@mandelbrot1975; @mandelbrot2021].

In one influential paper, drawing on previous work by mathematician Lewis Fry Richardson, @mandelbrot1967 argued that a rugged linear feature like a coastline cannot be fully described through traditional geometry with a set of line segments, since this would result in a curve of infinite complexity. More importantly, he showed that the traditional measure of lines -- the length -- will inevitably depend on the scale of observation when applied to a coastline. If measured in kilometres, a coastline will always appear shorter in total length, than if it is measured in metres, since smaller bays and inlets can then also be accounted for. But this phenomenon continues seemingly without limit, since the same coastline measured in centimetres will appear much longer, and in millimetres far longer again, and so on. Length as a measure of rugged linear features thus seems inadequate, which may become a problem in practical settings when comparing coastlines between countries that operate with different measurement units and procedures. The same problem occurs when describing irregular patterns in the plane (like island or continent outlines) with area or in three-dimensional space (like clouds or galaxies) with volume. As a solution, Mandelbrot proposed the use of the *fractal dimension* as a descriptive tool for characterising such patterns.

Fractals as hierarchy

Self-similarity and scale invariance

Processes/mechanisms that produce fractals:

-   Cascading bifurcations and confluences (splitting or merging - tree structure/arborescence/branching, and relation to size. Terminology borrowed from biology and fluid dynamics (including turbulence/turbulent flow)

The role of randomness - tidy and messy fractals (romanesco broccolis are not more fractal than regular broccolis, only more regular. Also: a system may be both random and deterministic, often only depending on scale of observation (chaos).

The relationship with (self-organised) criticality and chaos: deterministic *and* unpredictable

Fractals embedded in

-   Space (hence "fractal geometry"): geomorphology, plants, ocean and wind currents, galaxies, also human constructed features (see Chapter xx for details)

-   Time series: earthquakes, finance (not applied in this study, though should be done later)

-   Networks/abstract: hierarchical organisations, income distributions, word counts, 1/f or pink noise, www. @barabási1999 etc. (see Chapter xxx for details). Fractal social networks: @west2023.

-   Pure mathematics: Julia and Mandelbrot sets, strange attractors (don't go into details!)

No, not everything is fractal: e.g. Central Limit Theorem

Fractal analysis for studying irregular phenomena (methods described in more detail Chapters xxx), and thus as a tool for quantitative empirical research.

## Very short introduction to micro-macro approaches in social theory

-   Lévi-Strauss and Structuralism

-   Braudel and World Systems

-   Giddens and Structuration Theory

-   Delanda and Assemblage Theory

For social hierarchies, he refers to Weber's classification of legitimation strategies, as being founded on sacred tradition, personal charisma or rational bureaucracy [see also @graeber2021, pp.]. Delanda furthermore places Bourdieu's concept of *habitus* on the mid-range between micro and macro processes, as an explanation of social action that is not entirely individual dependent, but not emergent properties of society-as-a-whole either.

-   Latour and Actor-Network Theory

What these approaches all have in common, is that they are entirely qualitative (**check**).

-   That's not a problem in itself.

-   Quant approach is both possible for the stated purpose, and desirable for reasons of comparative analysis.

-   Data deluge (refer to chap. on geomagn data). The goal here is to establish a quantitative framework for studying social complexity and hierarchy in archaeological/prehistoric settings. Further articulating fractal analysis with existing social theoretical approaches is not the primary goal here, as it could constitute a separate research project. In the present thesis, bla bla.

END chapter.

Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this[^02-theory-general-1].

[^02-theory-general-1]: where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^02-theory-general-2]

[^02-theory-general-2]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$
